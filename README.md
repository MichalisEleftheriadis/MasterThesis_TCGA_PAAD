# Construction of a cuproptosis-related lncRNA predictive signature for pancreatic cancer patients

## Description: 
Cuproptosis is a new form of cell death in various tumours [1]. However, the mechanism of cuproptosis in pancreatic cancer has not been well studied. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNAs with lengths of over 200 nucleotides that generally do not encode proteins [2]. 

Ten cuproptosis-related lncRNAs were recently found to effectively assess the prognosis and molecular profile of clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients [3]. 

However, the mechanism of the copper-mediated death process in pancreatic cancer remains unclear, and there has been no study of cuproptosis-associated lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer.

In this study we will aim to explore the functions of lncRNAs related to cuproptosis in pancreatic cancer and develop a prognostic predictive model. 

RNA sequencing and clinicopathological data will be derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-PAAD) and randomly divided into training and validation groups. 
We will focus on 19 cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) from a previously published article [4]: NFE2L2, NLRP3, ATP7B, ATP7A, SLC31A1, FDX1, LIAS, LIPT1, LIPT2, DLD, DLAT, PDHA1, PDHB, MTF1, GLS, CDKN2A, DBT, GCSH, and DLST) After downloading the original files, the numbers of mutations and mutation sites of each gene in each sample will be extracted and used to construct a mutation matrix file.
